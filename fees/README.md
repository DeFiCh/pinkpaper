# Fees on DeFiChain

Usage of DeFiChain generally consists of the following fees:

1. Miner fee
2. Operator fee
3. DeFi fee

## Miner fee

Miner fee is the small fee, paid in UTXO DFI, to masternodes (also referred to as miners) for transaction validation and inclusion in a block.

This works the same as Bitcoin blockchain, measured in data size, e.g. price per byte.

## Operator fee

As part of DeFiChain generalization, many services will soon be run by [operators](../operator).

For providing of services and applications on DeFiChain, operators are able to determine fees for the services that they would charge freely. Fees can be in any form of tokens, DFI or operators' own tokens, or a combination of multiple tokens. What an operator chooses to do with the operator fee is at the operator's discretion.


## DeFi fee

DeFi fee is charged for all DeFi transactions on DeFiChain regardless of operators.
